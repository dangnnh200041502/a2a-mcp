# Owner Contact Card

A minimal, responsive static card that displays the project owner’s name and email.

## Files
- `index.html` – Markup for the card.
- `styles.css` – Styling for layout and theme.
- `script.js` – Optional initialization hook (ready for future enhancements).

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step or server is required.

## Customization
- Update name and email in `index.html`:
  - The elements `.owner-name` and `.owner-email a` contain the displayed values.
- Adjust theme in `styles.css` by editing CSS variables under `:root`.

## Notes
- This folder intentionally does not include build tooling.
- An extra `style.css` from an older calculator example is not used and can be removed.
